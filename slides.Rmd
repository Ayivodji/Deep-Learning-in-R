# What is deep learning? (long definition)

#### Deep Learning allows "computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deﬁned through its relation to simpler concepts. By gathering knowledge from experience, this approach avoids the need for human operators to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs.  

#### The hierarchy of concepts enables the computer to learn complicated concepts bybuilding them out of simpler ones. If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason, we call this approach to AI deep learning." (https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html, pp. 1-2)
