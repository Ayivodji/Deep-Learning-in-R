# Deep Learning in R

This is the repository for D-Lab’s Introduction to Deep Learning in R workshop.

## Objectives

Convey the basics of deep learning in R using keras on image datasets. Students are empowered with a general grasp of deep learning, example code that they can modify, a working computational environment, and resources for further study.

## Content outline

* Installation
  * R and RStudio
  * Keras and Tensorflow
  * Helper packages
* What is “deep” learning? 
* Understanding the dataset
* Dataset splitting: training, test, cross-validation
  * Defining moving parts of a deep learning model 
  * Understanding a loss function, activation function, and metrics
  * Performance evaluation
* Part 1-2
  * MNIST 0-9 hand-written digit example 
  * Dogs or humans?
* Part 3-4
  * Pre-trained models + fine-tuning
  * X-ray classification: abdominal vs. chest classification
  * Google Cloud Machine Learning

## Prerequisites

* D-Lab's [Machine Learning in R introduction](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Machine-Learning-in-R) (4 hours)
* Or, comparable experience/training, assuming familiarity with:
  * Basic R syntax
  * statistical concepts such as mean and standard deviation
  * Train/test splitting and cross-validation
  * Dataset cleaning
  * Overfitting / underfitting
  * Hyperparameter customization

## Technology requirements

Please bring a laptop with the following:

* [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
3.4 or greater
* [RStudio integrated development environment (IDE)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is
highly recommended but not required.
