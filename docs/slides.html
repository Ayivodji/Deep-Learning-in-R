# What is deep learning? (long)

#### Deep Learning allows "computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deﬁned through its relation to simpler concepts. By gathering knowledge from experience, this approach avoids the need for human operators to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs.  

#### The hierarchy of concepts enables the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason, we call this approach to AI deep learning."  

#### (https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html, pp. 1-2)

# What is deep learning? (short)

### - A subfield of machine learning that utilizes multi-layered artificial neural networks for modelling and prediction of data. 

### - These models can be applied to numeric, categorical, image, text, and time-series data. 

### - For images, neural networks convert the image to a matrix of pixel values. Therefore it is useful to think of images as giant matrices!

# What makes a neural network "deep"?

&lt;img src="slide_img/deep.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# How does it work? 

#### 1. Supervised neural networks require "features", or an **input layer** of data that is used to produce our estimated **output layer**, or estimated classification of an actual image.  

#### 2. This input layer is initialized with a vector of randomized weights and a bias term of "1" is added. 

#### 3. The products of these input features and their weights are summed and  transformed. This summed value is passed through an activation function to determine the threshold if our prediction should be classified as a 0 or a 1. A learning rate is also be specified. 

---

# How does it work? 

#### 4. Error is computed as target value minus our estimation. The weights delta metric (how much the errors should change) is calculated as the error times the slope of the point on the activation function times the vector of input features. 

#### 5. The vector of original weights is added to the vector of updated weights and are "backpropagated" (used as the recycled input) and passed through the model for another epoch.  

#### 6. With deep networks, the process also takes places between **hidden layers**, or areas of nonlinear transformations connected only to the layers before and after them. They are referred to as "hidden" because they are not show as the final output.

# Part 1 functions

#### `data_mnist()`
#### `array_reshape()`
#### `to_categorical()`
#### `layer_dense()`
#### `layer_dropout()`
#### `compile()`
#### `fit()`
#### `evaluate()`

---

Part 1
# `data_mnist`
[Load the MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using the built-in function and assign the training and test X and Y variables: 

#### Training set
`x_train = mnist$train$x`  
`y_train = mnist$train$y`

#### Validation (test) set
`x_test = mnist$test$x`  
`y_test = mnist$test$y`

#### Note the array dimension differences
`str(mnist$train$x)`  
`str(x_train)`
---

Part 1
# `array_reshape`
This function converts our 3D tensor (samples, height, width) to a 2D one (samples, input shape). 

`x_train = array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), height * width))`  

`x_test = array_reshape(x_test, c(nrow(x_test), height * width))`

#### Check new dimensions (2D)
`str(x_train)`  
`str(x_test)`  

#### Gray rescale:  
`x_train = x_train / 255`  
`x_test = x_test / 255`

---

Part 1
# `to_categorical`
Convert integer vector to binary class matrix. Specify the train and test labels and the number of Y classes (10, the numbers 0 thru 9).  

`y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)`  

`y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)`

---

Part 1
# `keras_model_sequential`
This function allows us to build a linear stack of layers. We will make a model with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. We need to define:  
- The number of units in the layer.  
- Activation function: how to determine the output of a node (e.g., relu, sigmoid).  
- Input shape: image dimensions  
- Dropout: a regularization method for preventing overfitting by reducing the number of units in a layer during a pass/epoch.  
---

Part 1

`model = keras_model_sequential() `

`model %&gt;%`
  
**INPUT LAYER**  
  `layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %&gt;%` 
  
  `layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %&gt;%` 
  
**HIDDEN LAYER**  
  `layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %&gt;%`
  
  `layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %&gt;%`
  
**OUTPUT LAYER**  
  `layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')`

`summary(model)`

---

Part 1
# `compile` 
Here we can define the performance evaluation metrics to be incorporated into the model.  

**Loss function:** measures the difference in distance scores between predicted and actual outcomes (i.e., a residual); we hope to minimize this value.  

**Optimizer function:** responsible for the backpropagation algorithm; defines how the loss function's gradient will update the weights. Also associated with the optimizer is the "learning rate", or by _how much_ should we update these weights?  
  
**Performance metric:** We can just choose accuracy since we are tasked with a multinomial classification problem of ten handwritten digits.  

`model %&gt;% compile(loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 0.001), metrics = c('accuracy'))`

---

Part 1
# `fit`
We are almost ready to train the model, but we first need to provide a few more specifications. 

- X and Y training data   
- The number of epochs (full passes) where the weight gradients will be computed to update the weights. 
- Batch size: number of samples from the training set to be used in a single epoch. An "iteration" is the number of batches necessary to complete one epoch, where gradients are computed relative to the loss of the individual batch. 
- Validation split: percentage of data to be used as the validation set (0.2 means last 20%).  

`history = model %&gt;% fit(x_train, y_train, epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, validation_split = 0.2)`

---
Part 1  
# `evaluate`
Predict on the test set!  

`model %&gt;% evaluate(x_test, y_test)`

---

# Part 1 Challenge
### Write down the steps you followed to run this model from start to finish. What does each part do? 

---

# Part 2 functions
#### `list_files`  
#### `image_data_generator`  
#### `flow_from_directory`  
#### `keras_model_sequential`  
#### `layer_flatten`, `layer_dense`, `layer_dropout`  
#### `compile`  
#### `fit_generator`  
#### `evaluate_generator`  

---

Part 2  

Now that you are warmed up, let's see what Keras can do when we have our own folders of images. Here we have two folders of [dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) and [people](http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/), located in training and validation directories. 

`train_path = "data-raw/dog-human/TRAIN"`  

`val_path = "data-raw/dog-human/VAL"`  

# `list_files`
Listing the files prints the full file paths of our images.  

`train_images = list.files(train_path, full.names = T, recursive = T)`  

`val_images = list.files(val_path, full.names = T, recursive = T)`

---

Part 2  

We can fit the model like before, by defining the number of units in each layer, the activation function, the input size, etc. However we should also specify: 
- Image width and height  
- Batch size  
- Number of training samples  
- Number of validation samples  
- Epochs  

---

Part 2
# `image_data_generator`
This function [performs data augmentation](https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/image_data_generator.html). It contains many tunable parameters, but we will just use the rescale to the gray channel. 

`train_datagen = keras::image_data_generator(rescale = 1/255)`  

`val_datagen = keras::image_data_generator(rescale = 1/255)`
---

Part 2
# `flow_from_directory`
Here we can configure the training model. You will need to define: 
- The file paths to the training and test data  
- Image shape  
- Batch size  
- Output class: binary
- Color profile: grayscale

&gt; Remember this is a Pythonic "method"! 

---

Part 2
# `keras_model_sequential`

Fit the model! 

Same as Part 1, except we need to first flatten the three dimensional array to one dimension:  

`layer_flatten(input_shape = c(img_width, img_height, 1))`

The `compile` step (loss function, activation function, and performance metric) is also the same as Part 1. 

---

Part 2

# `fit_generator`
This fits the training model configuration (using `flow_from_directory`)  
- Steps per epoch: the number of batch runs to complete one full iteration of training.  
- Epochs: 
- Validation data: the validation model 
- Validation steps: the number of batch runs needed to complete one full iteration of validation.  

`history = model %&gt;%`
  `fit_generator(train_gen, steps_per_epoch = as.integer(num_train_samples / batch_size),`
  `epochs = epochs, validation_data = val_gen, validation_steps = as.integer(num_validation_samples / batch_size))`

---

Part 2
# `evaluate_generator`
Predict on the validation data! 

model %&gt;% evaluate_generator(generator = val_gen, steps = 10)

---

# Part 2 Challenge
How can we improve performance of this neural network? [Read this excellent post](https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607) to learn 37 different ways. Try tuning some of our model (hypter)parameters in the above code to see if you can improve model performance.
